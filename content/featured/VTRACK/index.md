Manufacturing factories produces many products on a given day. This makes it difficult for manual labour to check the
quality of products, as products are moving fast through the conveyor belt. The purpose of this project is to build a software system which will be able to monitor the production
processes in manufacturing factories. The software will monitor
a conveyor belt on which manufactured objects are moving past using an overhead camera. We aim to
find an efficient solution and develop a sensible system design according to good software engineering
practices to track how proficient their factories are
