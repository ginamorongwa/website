As academic institutions offer support and learning systems to students during their academic careers, the structure and optimal utilization of these systems remains questionable. As higher education institutions are becoming highly competitive, it is crucial that support systems offered to students are efficient and of great value to ensure that respective institutions are marketable.

The solution implemented was a system that contains 3 main components namely the social media, publishing/recommender, and a time management component.

Thus, this project aims to provide an engaging user-friendly student support system to university students and ensure that relevant university content is delivered to students when they need it the most, by tracking the manner in which students utilize the system.
